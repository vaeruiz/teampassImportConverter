Fixes the formatting errors when exporting csv items in Teampass

## How to use

1. Download the csv with the items (if it redirects you to hacking attempt, click again on export objects and download, repeat until the file is downloaded).
2. Deletes the comments/description field (has bad characters like Ã±->N&ia), you can use excel or any spreadsheet processor (I also recommend removing commas and double-quotes from the file to avoid errors when converting the file).
3. Send the file to your linux system where the script is located.
4. Type:
